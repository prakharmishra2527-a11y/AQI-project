# AQI-project
An Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction project uses machine learning or deep learning techniques to forecast future air pollution levels based on historical data, pollutant concentrations, and meteorological factors. The goal is to provide timely, actionable information for public health and environmental management. 

Predict the Air Quality Index (AQI): Develop a reliable model to forecast the numerical AQI value and its corresponding category (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, or Hazardous).
Protect Public Health: Enable individuals, healthcare providers, and government agencies to take proactive measures to reduce exposure to air pollution, such as planning outdoor activities or issuing health alerts.
Aid Environmental Management and Policy: Provide data-driven insights to policymakers for formulating effective pollution control strategies, such as managing industrial emissions or traffic flow.
Improve Awareness: Contribute to general public awareness about air pollution issues and its potential health and environmental impacts.
